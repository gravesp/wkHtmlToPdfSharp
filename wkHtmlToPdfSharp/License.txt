Changes made:
- Moved Synchronized into main Assembly
- Added files for .NET 2.0 support in Net20 (remove if you build in .NET-Version with LINQ etc.)
- Renamed namespace Pechkin to wkHtmlToPdfSharp
- Used wkhtmltox32*.dll from https://github.com/pruiz/WkHtmlToXSharp because they are statically linked
- Moved wkhtmltox32*.dll into embedded resources and added extraction to loader
- Added shared library loader (DllLoader.cs). Web-application in IIS must load the library before it can be used.
